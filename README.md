# digital-agency-landing-page

A small responsive HTML landing page for a digital agency.

Figma template: https://www.figma.com/file/4sRJlpHJqzRZIXw3NeRS5k/index.html.

I made that landing page template using only HTML and CSS/SCSS technology several months ago while learning HTML basics in my web development school. Figma template was provided for free by my student project curator, and I don’t own it. The template is responsive and automatically change layouts depending on the viewer’s device.
